# Processing-Data-Using-Pandas
The hands on project is completed from the reference : https://www.coursera.org/learn/processing-data-with-python/home/week/1
Processing data is used in virtually every field these days. It is used for analyzing web traffic to determine personal preferences, 
gathering scientific data for biological analysis, analyzing weather patterns, business practices, and on. Data can take on many different
forms and come from many different sources. Python is an open-source (free) programming language that is used in web programming, data science, 
artificial intelligence, and many scientific applications. It has libraries that can be used to parse and quickly analyze the data in whatever 
form it comes in, whether it be in XML, CSV, or JSON format. Data cleaning is an important aspect of processing data, particularly in the field of data science.

I have performed the following tasks in the project:

1. Create a Pandas DataFrame
2. Read Data from Files
3. Cleaning Data
4. Data Analysis
5. Data Subset
